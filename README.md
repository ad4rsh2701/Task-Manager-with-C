# TASK MANAGER
Based on C programming Language. 
The purpose of this repo is to achieve a basic Task Management System.

## What's this?
This is a project on a basic Task Manager based on C that will perform basic tasks such as:
1. Create Tasks
2. Edit Tasks
3. Delete Tasks
4. Mark Taks as completed
5. Create Tasks with due dates
6. Mark Tasks as incomplete
7. Mark Tasks as completed late
8. Store completed tasks

## But that's nothing new!
Yes, that's just a basic task manager for now. More implementations like the following are to be added later:
1. Rewarding system based on how quickly the task is completed
2. Rate of completion of tasks
3. Percentage of tasks completed on time versus Percentage of tasks completed late
4. Milestones
5. Reminder system

## That's it?
As of now, yes. This will all be console based for now. Later on, more features and maybe swicth to GUI may occur.
